# PHP Kata Starter

A PHP starting point with first failing test for the [String Calculator Kata](http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/) using PHPUnit. Designed to be reset after use.

Clone the repo, run `composer install` and then `vendor/bin/phpunit StringCalculatorTest.php` in a console to run tests via CLI or alternatively configure it in the IDE.
